Our toolkit comes packed with features, including:

- Easy integration with Folium for interactive web-based maps.
- Automatic retrieval of historical site coordinates from your datasets.
- Smart estimation of paths that consider terrain features.
- Paths that follow valleys and avoid mountains intelligently.
- Lots of options to customize map styles and visual themes.
- Robust error handling and logging to ensure reliability.
- Modular design for easy integration with other tools.
- Detailed documentation to guide you every step of the way.
